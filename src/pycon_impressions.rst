 Thoughts from PyCon US
========================

.. roads
.. links
.. robots

After an amazing week I'm sadly going back to the UK.

After two PyCon Italy and one Europycon last year this time I decided that I really wanted to come to Pycon Us, and I'm very glad I did.

Coming from Bristol has been an exhausting trip, with the 3-4 hours
delay of the airplane in London in took me exactly 24 hours from the
time I left my house to the time I got to the hotel.

I had only some vague ideas about what the silicon valley really is,
but the first and most impressive thing is definitively the sizes.

Everything is bigger there, roads, buildings and cars, Santa Clara
seems to be designed for giants or for cars, definitively not for
human beings without wheels.



.. special thanks to the foundation
