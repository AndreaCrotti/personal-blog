 Thoughts from PyCon US
========================

.. roads
.. links
.. robots

After an amazing week I'm sadly going back to the UK.

After two PyCon Italy and one Europycon last year this time I decided that I really wanted to come to Pycon Us, and I'm very glad I did.

Trip
====

Coming from Bristol has been an exhausting trip, with the 3-4 hours
delay of the airplane in London in took me exactly 24 hours from the
time I left my house to the time I got to the hotel.

I had only some vague ideas about what the silicon valley really is,
but the first and most impressive thing is definitively the sizes.

Everything is bigger there, roads, buildings and cars, Santa Clara
seems to be designed for giants or for cars, definitively not for
human beings without wheels.

Thurdsday
=========

So Thursday I did my first and only tutorial, still slightly KO from
the jet-lag and the long trip.  It started well but it became quite
boring in the end, and there wasn't any hands-on session.

Frankly I don't see the point of a tutorial composed *only* of slides
and demos which I can't even possibly reproduce.  I understand that
it's hard to set up and to get something useful done it's not easy,
but it's really not fulfilling to watch someone else doing a demo
without even understanding what he's doing.

One possible solution would be to prepare all the boiler-plate code
before, and make it available (even before the tutorial) to the people
attending.

With a clear and simply API that abstracts the complicated bits it
would much easier to actually get something nice done during the
tutorial.

Friday
======

Friday it was the great day, and we started off with an amazing
robot-dance, it was absolutely awesome, these little robots really
look humans, and I can only imagine how hard it must be to program
a synchronized choreograph with such natural movements.

.. special thanks to the foundation
