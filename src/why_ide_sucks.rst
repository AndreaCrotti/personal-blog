Why IDE sucks
#############

:status: draft

This article is about productivity, as a conclusion of many years of
tinkering and trying every possible thing.


Designed with a specific language in mind
=========================================

Every IDE is designed with a particular language in mind.  This is not
in general a bad thing, but unless you plan to use *one* and *only
one* programming language, you will experience that the quality of the
plugins for other languages will not be the same.


Slow and extremely memory hungry
================================

Even on a very fast machine, firing up an IDE takes ages, and
allocates insane amount of memory.  You might say that it's not a
problem, we have power and we have a lot of cheap memory, so why
bother.

But suppose you're working with a netbook, working with that same IDE
is not so much fun anymore, and you end up with your good old
text-editor to get some work done.


Hard to extend or customise
===========================



When they break you're screwed
==============================
