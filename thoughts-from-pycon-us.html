<p>After an amazing week I'm sadly going back to the UK.</p>
<p>After two PyCon Italy and one Europycon last year this time I decided that I really wanted to come to Pycon Us, and I'm very glad I did.</p>
<div class="section" id="trip">
<h2>Trip</h2>
<p>Coming from Bristol has been an exhausting trip, with the 3-4 hours
delay of the airplane in London in took me exactly 24 hours from the
time I left my house to the time I got to the hotel.</p>
<p>I had only some vague ideas about what the silicon valley really is,
but the first and most impressive thing is definitively the sizes.</p>
<p>Everything is bigger there, roads, buildings and cars, Santa Clara
seems to be designed for giants or for cars, definitively not for
human beings without wheels.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tutorials">
<h2>Tutorials</h2>
<p>So Thursday I did my first and only tutorial, still slightly KO from
the jet-lag and the long trip.  It started well but it became quite
boring in the end, and there wasn't any hands-on session.</p>
<p>Frankly I don't see the point of a tutorial composed <em>only</em> of slides
and demos which I can't even possibly reproduce.  I understand that
it's hard to set up and to get something useful done it's not easy,
but it's really not fulfilling to watch someone else doing a demo
without even understanding what he's doing.</p>
<p>One possible solution would be to prepare all the boiler-plate code
before, and make it available (even before the tutorial) to the people
attending.</p>
<p>With a clear set of prepared tools and modules that abstracts the
boring parts it would much easier to actually get something nice done
during the tutorial.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conference">
<h2>Conference</h2>
<p>Friday it was the great day, and we started off with an amazing
robot-dance, it was absolutely awesome, these little robots really
look humans, and I can only imagine how hard it must be to program
a synchronized choreograph with such natural movements.</p>
<p>Saturday</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sprints">
<h2>Sprints</h2>
<p>This was my first sprint session and I'm very glad I did it.  After
Sunday night I thought that only a few people would have actually
remained, I was quite wrong and on Monday apparently more than 700
people were still in the hotel coding like crazy.</p>
<p>I first joined the python-dev group and thanks to Martin LÃ¶wis I now
have a very work flow to contribute, with my own clone of the CPython
sources on bitbucket.</p>
<p>Then I joined Barry Warsaw and the GNU Mailman team, and after one day
I already had a couple of branches merged into trunk.</p>
