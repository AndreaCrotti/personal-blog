Rule of divisor by three
########################

:status: draft

Maybe many of you already know this simple trick to check if a number
is divisible by three.

If summing up all the digits from a number sums up to a multiple of 3
then the number is divisible by three.

For example:

- 57 -> 5 + 7 = 12, 12 is divisible by 3 thus 57 is divisible by 3
- 23 -> 2 + 4 = 5, 5 is not divisible by 3 thus 23 is not divisible by 3
