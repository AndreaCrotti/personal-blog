Thoughts from PyCon US

After an amazing week I'm sadly back to the UK.
After two PyCon Italy and one Europycon last year this time I decided
that I really wanted to come to Pycon Us, and I'm very glad I did.

Trip
====

Coming from Bristol has been an exhausting trip, with the 3-4 hours
delay of the airplane in London it took me exactly 24 hours from the
time I left my house to the time I got to the hotel in Santa Clara.

I had only some vague ideas about what the silicon valley really is,
but the first and most impressive thing is definitively the sizes.

Everything is bigger there: roads, buildings, cars 

Tutorials
=========

So Thursday I did my first and only tutorial, still slightly KO from
the jet-lag and the long trip.  It started well but it became quite
boring in the end, and there wasn't any hands-on session.

Frankly I don't see the point of a tutorial composed *only* of slides
and demos which I can't even possibly reproduce.  I understand that
it's hard to set up and to get something useful done it's not easy,
but it's really not fulfilling to watch someone else doing a demo
without even understanding what he's doing.

One possible solution would be to prepare all the boiler-plate code
before, and make it available (even before the tutorial) to the people
attending.

With a clear set of prepared tools and modules that abstracts the
boring parts it would much easier to actually get something nice done
during the tutorial.


Conference
==========

Friday it was the great day, and we started off with an amazing
robot-dance, it was absolutely awesome, these little robots really
look humans, and I can only imagine how hard it must be to program
a synchronized choreograph with such natural movements.

Saturday

Sprints
=======

This was my first sprint session and I'm very glad I did it.  After
Sunday night I thought that only a few people would have actually
remained, I was quite wrong and on Monday apparently more than 700
people were still in the hotel coding like crazy.

I first joined the python-dev group and thanks to Martin LÃ¶wis I now
have a very work flow to contribute, with my own clone of the CPython
sources on bitbucket.

Then I joined Barry Warsaw and the GNU Mailman team, and after one day
I already had a couple of branches merged into trunk.


Conclusion
==========

.. special thanks to the foundation
